customizations i use for rym. theyre kind of evil sorry. ive been maintaining these for myself over the past few years so i dont remember everything it does but here's what i notice missing when i use rym without them:

### css
\- most prominently the chart page is reorganized so all the settings are on the right again
\- spoilers are recolored to look better with dark mode
\- lots of resizing / font changes / recoloring like above in general, this is the stuff thats a bit difficult to remember. another example: fixed awkward spacing on userpage notification box notifications
\- genre page descriptions automatically appear fully expanded

### js
\- some styles that were too annoying to do with normal css
\- genre and charts links are switched to how they were arranged before like summer of 2021. i kept clicking genres habitually and got tired of it pretty fast
\- removes featured reviews from release pages. in the future i plan to just move it down if possible but after recently glancing quickly at how theyre implemented it'll probably be more time than it's worth
\- removes rym box set lists. self explanatory
